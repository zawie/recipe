### Steps

#### Preparation

- *Meat*: Chop the chicken into 1/2 to 1 inch pieces. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, a teaspon of minced garlic, and Italian seasoning.
Add some lemon juice (half a lemon); pro tip, you can stick a fork in it and squeeze to get more out. Add some butter if desired.
- *Vegetables*: Dice a whole onion and 150g+ of Mushroom (the more the merrier).
- *Sauce*: Blend/mix 200g Greek yogurt, 300g Cottage cheese, and at least 50g Parmesan cheese

#### Cooking

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT let the sauce simmer
```

- Cook the pasta according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
- Bake the chicken in the oven for 20 minutes at 420‚Ñâ. Occasionally open and mix chicken to ensure evenly cooked. (Chose to bake chicken since it's less scary and my stovetop is not that big...)
- Cook vegetables on low heat on pan in the meantime with some oil.
- Once the Chicken is baked, add it with the vegetables (Note to self, probably drain water after baking otherwise its too liquidy)
- Add 150ml of Chicken broth (0.6 cups)
- Add the sauce; do not let it simmer. It will curdle and ruin the sauce. Just mix it in and let it warm up a bit.
- Add the pasta and mix well. Optionally add some more cheese on top.

Viola, you have a delicious chicken alfredo pasta dish! Serve with some parsely on top for some color.

### Notes & Tips

**Storage Recommendation**: Cooked chicken can be stored 3-4 days in the fridge. I recommend storing 2-3 servings in the fridge and freezing the rest.

Notes to Self:

- Need to buy a proper blender; the dingy thing I had was not strong enough.
- Sauce was too liquidy, will try to drain the chicken after baking.
